                <p class="subtitle">This is just a fun web page
                    that I wanted to make. I like watching anime
                    movies so I thought I'd make a page where I
                    tell people (who just started watching anime)
                    some great anime movies in my opinion.

                    <h2 class="movie-title">I want to eat your Pancreas</h2>
                    <p class="about-movie">Honestly, this movie broke me. Some people
                        don't realise the importance of living life at the fullest.
                        Haruki Shiga was one of them. People like him don't feel the necessity 
                        to make friends which ends up being a major problem later because
                        believe it or not, at the end of the day, you need someone whom
                        you can share your problems and make a connection with them.
                        "Sakura Yamauchi", the female protagonist of the movie sees "Haruki
                        Shiga", the male protagonist reading her diary named 'Living with Dying'.
                        She seemed to notice that Haruki doesn't really care about the fact that
                        she had terminal illness and that she was going to die. That's when she
                        decided to be friends with him and they started spending their time
                        together. Overtime, we see a change in the personalty of Haruki Shiga who
                        has now started to value his life more.
                        Now I won't spoil the whole movie here so, if you are thinking of watching
                        a movie, I'd say this one will be great.

                    <p class="about-movie">This one is also a heart-breaking anime. The female protagonist
                        Shoko Nishimiya a transfer student who was born deaf faced bullying by the friend
                        group of Shoya Ishida. He often bullied her and when the principle heard of the
                        bullying Shoya's friends pinned all the blame to Shoya. After this he started to
                        blame Shoko and got into a physical fight with her. Later she changed schools when
                        it became too much to bear. Shoya's reputation of a bully followed him through middle
                        school. He became a depressed loner and lost the ability to look people in the eyes.
                        He felt so guilty that he started to believe suicide was the only absolution for him.
                        Overtime, Shoya learns to forgive himself for all the wrong he had done while trying
                        to connect with those around who cared for him. At the start of the movie we see a
                        cross mark appearing on everyone from Shoya's perspective. That cross mark eventually
                        wears off at the end with Shoya, finally being able to let loose all of the emotions
                        that had been inside him for a long time.

                    <h2 class="movie-title">Rascal Does Not Dream of a Knapsack Kid</h2>
                    <p class="about-movie">I watched this recently and as always, this series made me cry.
                        Rascal Does Not Dream is a great series and this movie is the latest till now but
                        that is going to be changed soon as 'The University Arc' is dropping in the first
                        week of July! Well I won't talk about it here. So, the movie <i>'Rascal Does Not Dream
                        of a Knapsack Kid'</i> is the continuation of of Rascal Does Not Dream series in which
                        we see that the male protagonist 'Sakuta Azusagawa' is experiencing yet another
                        puberty syndrome but this time it's a well known one. That is because it is the same
                        puberty syndrome that Mai Sakurajima had at the start of this anime. He thinks it's
                        because of visiting his mom after a very long time. Throughout the anime we don't see
                        him interacting with his mom that much. To simply say it, 'He thinks that he had forgotten
                        his mom' because of living seperately for many years. He did everything by himself for those
                        years, pretty much forgetting about his parents and because of that he felt guilty. When he
                        tells all this to Mai Sakurajima, she said, "That's what growing up means." That's when he
                        broke down and tears fell from his eyes. There was a younger version of Mai Sakurajima whom
                        only Sakuta could see. She was helping him change between two worlds, one in which he is
                        remembered and nothing had gone wrong at the start, and the other one in which he is invisible
                        to everyone except Mai Sakurajima. He chose the second world and finally reunited with his mom.
